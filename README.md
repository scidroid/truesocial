# TrueSocial

This is a AI-powered social network using DeSo and others cool things.

In this moneropo each package has a dockerfile :).

## About

Social networks are increasingly becoming a space for disinformation, social manipulation, promotion of malpractice and much more.

And this has become the standard, where the likes of a photo on instagram depends on how well the person knows how to edit, or how attractive a publication looks, which encourages young people to fall into things like anorexia, mental complexes, etc..

That's why I created TrueSocial, a social network that is based on who you are and how you feel.

## Run without docker

```bash
cd frontend

yarn
# or

```

You must have a deta project key and add it to an .env file.
